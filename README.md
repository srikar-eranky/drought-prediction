# drought-prediction
This project attempts to predict drought using machine learning.

Drought has been an increasingly relevant and severe problem all around the world, and especially in California. 
Current statistical models are insufficient for predicting drought, which is why scientists have turned to machine learning and deep learning recently. 
I attempt to use a novel machine learning method to predict the severity of drought, which can potentially help prevent water shortages, crop failures, and wildfires.
